# Triangle Tracker
#### The application enables a user to determine different type of triangle. 30/11/2018
#### Authors **Chrispus Ngure**
## Description
The application will return the type of triangle when it receives length values.
These are equilateral, isosceles, scalene and no triangle. A user will be required
to input 3 length values for each side of a triangle.  
## Technologies Used
Languages used are JavaScript, HTML and CSS. A web browser such as Chrome and
Safari would be used to launch the appliaction. An interesting challenge...
## Setup Instructions

## Behaviour Driven Development  
I established that the application should handle four categories of triangles;
equilateral, isosceles, scalene and no triagle, when it receives 3 equal lengths;
2 equal lengths; no equal length; and 2 lengths whose sum is equal or less than
a third side. It should return equilateral, isosceles, scalene or no triangle.
