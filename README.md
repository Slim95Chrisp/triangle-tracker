#### Authors **Chrispus Ngure**
## Description
The application will return the type of triangle when it receives length values.
These are equilateral, isosceles, scalene and no triangle. A user will be required
to input 3 length values for each side of a triangle.
## Technologies Used
Languages used are JavaScript, HTML and CSS. A web browser such as Chrome and
Safari would be used to launch the applicaction. The challenge was editing
the syntax. Using the Chrome console & JSFiddle helped.
## Setup Instructions
Input the length values in the form and click Submit.
